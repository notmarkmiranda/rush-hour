# DTR Memo
## Project: Rush Hour ##
### Group Member Names: Drew, Ling, Mark ###
* #### What does each group member hope to get out of the project? What are your goals and expectations for the project? ####
    * Understand how web traffic works
    * Dig into HTTP concepts including headers, referrers, and payload
    * Design a normalized SQL-based relational database structure
    * Use ActiveRecord to interface with the database from Ruby
    * Practice fundamental database storage and retrieval
    * Understand and practice HTTP verbs including GET, PUT, and POST
    * Practice using fundamental HTML and CSS to create a usable web interface

      * D - Use testing effectively, get full understanding of all concepts in play, don’t get burnt our early, do some extensions
      * L - (1) improve Ruby/program logic design; (2) become more comfortable with new set of lingo ; (3) try an extension if possible, but not imminent; (4) not lose momentum during the project from fatigue
      * M - Become stronger at the conversion between mod 1 and 2 (creating strong connections of ruby concepts and web interfaces). I'd like to complete as many of the extensions as possible.


* #### When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed? ####
  * D - no critical timing issues, prefer to leave earlier, but not necessary
  * L - i’m available at all times. except for thursday, i have a doctor’s appointment around 5ish, but i can come back. i should be able to get back by 630.
  * M - im going to the turing thing tonight from (6-8). wednesday i have to leave school early for a doctors appointment, but can come back afterwards, saturday, dropping my dog off for a bath.  aside from that, . i dont have any time restrictions i can think of


* #### How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained? ####
  * D - slack is good, if you wanna text i’m down, too
  * L - slack, in-person; i also operate pretty directly. additionally, sometimes my directness may be misunderstood, particularly in the midst of the project as we talk through a problem. i’m working on having better tone. so if any one feels like i’m coming off as condescending, please talk to me!
  * M - slack, to my face, not e-mail.. i don't like e-mail. if i'm being an asshole or not pulling my weight, just tell me.


* #### What is each group member’s self-identified strength(s) technically? What does each group member want to improve on technically? How can the team assist with these improvements? ####
  * D - Strength- refactoring, problem-solving, weakness/improve- TDD, how to help me- don’t let me write code without tests...
  * L - strength - TDD, quick to learn new concepts and apply them… weakness/improve - Git workflow,  design of models
  * M - I feel like I'm pretty well balanced in most areas, but not super strong in others like refactoring. I'm pretty good at boostrap. I think I tend to make things worse when refactoring. Help me refactor.


* #### Which feature(s) does each group member want to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member not want to work on? ####
  * D - I’d prefer to do less of the front stuff, such as css, etc... i can be team lead
  * L - anything but styling..i can manage waffle
  * M - I'm pretty open to working on anything. I don't think I fill a "lead" position, but can if necessary? I can do styling.


* #### What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when? ####
  * D - Git wf: create pull request, 1 other person must look at it before it’s pushed to master
  * L - Drew ultimately merge the PRs, but maybe we can do team code reviews prior to doing so? Just an idea. and we can do it at the end of standups
  * M - 1 merger (Drew), code reviewed by non-coder person.


* #### What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature? ####
  * D - I think that you should obviously spend some time trying to figure it out on your own… mostly for your own benefit in being able to solve your own problems, I normally say give it 15-30 minutes before you ask.
  * L - ditto
  * M - Ask for help. I feel like this is super basic, but maybe not if it’s on a DTR template.


* #### How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered? ####
  * D - in-person
  * L - in-person
  * M - in-person


* #### Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles? ####
  * D -
  * L -
  * M -


* #### Additional Notes: ####
